        <h1 class="title">Avmath math module</h1>

        <p class="block-text">Avmath is a Python module for mathematical purposes.
            It contains functionalities for simple mathematical
            usage as sine or logarithm functions and submodules
            for more advanced applied math in the topics of analysis
            and linear algebra. The module uses a mathematical syntax.
            The classes and functions are named in a mathematical
            manner and the class operations enable a mathematical workflow.
            Its issue is to calculate as accurate as possible and not firstly
            the aspect of time. </p>

        <a href="./docs/?a=fraction"><h3 class="feature-sub">Fractions</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            Avmath provides a datatype for fractions for the 
            purpose of easy calculations. It can be used with
            other number types because it contains methods for
            mathematical operations with the built-in operators
            as +, -, * and /. Fractions with integer values can be reduced.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?a=functions"><h3 class="feature-sub">Functions</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            The module contains various functions for arithmetic
            usage as the greatest common divisor or the detection
            of prime numbers. It also gives access to mathematical
            functions as the sine or cosine or logarithms of a real
            number.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?a=constants"><h3 class="feature-sub">Constants</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            Avmath enables the usage of mathematical constants as &pi; 
            or <i>e</i> or a list of all two digit prime numbers.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=algebra.html"><h3 class="feature-topic">Linear algebra</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            The linear algebra is an important mathematical domain and has many 
            usages in programming. The avmath submodule algebra deals with algebraic
            objects and their relations.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=algebra.html&a=tuples"><h3 class="feature-sub">Tuples</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            Algebraic tuples can be used to store and manipulate number values
            or serve as point in geometrical constructions.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=algebra.html&a=vectors"><h3 class="feature-sub">Vectors</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            Vectors are useful objects for calculations in mathematics and natural sciences.
            The avmath algebra vector class provides a wide span of features for vector operations.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=algebra.html&a=matrices"><h3 class="feature-sub">Matrices</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            Avmath matrices contain many important methods for an easy handling of complicated matrix operations.
            The algorithms can serve for simple matrix addition or multiplication for the calculation of determinants
            and solve eigenvalue problems.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=algebra.html&a=sles"><h3 class="feature-sub">Systems of linear equations</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            SLEs are a part of many mathematical or engineering problems. The library provides easy-to-use features for
            the declaration and solution of the systems.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=analysis.html"><p3 class="feature-topic">Analysis / Calculus</p3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            The field of calculus has wide possibilities of usage in many aspects of programming. Avmath helps with
            easy usable tools for many calculations.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=analysis.html&a=function"><h3 class="feature-sub">Common functions</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            Any imaginable function <i>f(x)</i> can be implemented in your program using the avmath analysis function.
            The function terms can be given as strings to give a maximum of flexibility. The class supports combinations
            of functions finds roots, extrema and can calculate derivatives and certain integrals.
        </p>

        <a href="./docs/?s=analysis.html&a=polynomial"><h3 class="feature-sub">Polynomial functions</h3></a>

        <p class="block-text">
            Polynomials are one of the most used function types. Avmath performs addition and multiplication methods finds real
            and complex roots of polynomials and can calculate extrema. The methods for infinitesimal calculations contain derivative values
            and functions and certain and incertain integrals.

        <h2 class="paragraph">Version history</h2>

        <p class="block-text">Avmath 3 introduced the possibility to accurately
            calculate objects inlinear algebra using fractions. Many obsolete
            parts were deleted. Many bugs of version 2 were closed and new features
            implemented. Avmath 2 ended the former dependency to the math module.
            All mathematical problems are now solved independently. There have been
            changes in function names and parameters because of necessary syntax changes
            and corrections in names. Also, the implementation of functions was done.
            The Taylor-functions sometimes lack of speed andaccuracy. Many functions and
            methods had visible and invisible bugs. Avmath 1 was the first GitHub version
            of avmath. It had the basic functionalities of the later avmath, but especially advanced
            matrix and function features were missing.</p>    
            
            
        <p class="block-text">Even though avmath 1 was the first version on GitHub,
            there existed older versions of avmath - or former: evmath. The last version
            of evmath can be found on PyPi too. Yet there was no documentation of changes.</p>

        <p class="block-text">The first drafts of avmath are dated on the 22nd of March 2021.
